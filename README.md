# Hammerstein
Raspberry Pi / Arduino Autonomous and Web Controlled Robot  
This repository contains code used in my Raspberry Pi / Arduino autonomous robot that can also be controlled via a web page.
There are three files:
Hammerstein_2.0.py - This is the python code.
Hammerstein.html - this is the web page.
i2c_Serial_Slave <should have a version number> - this is the Arduino Sketch code for the Arduino Nano AT-Mega328P used to drive the motors and servo as well as reading the ultrasonic sensor.

An Instrucatble providing some info on the robot build can be found here:
